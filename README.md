Navigator Injector Backbone Command TodoMVC
=========================================
A [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) implementation based on
[navigator-injector-backbone-command-setup](https://github.com/PaulTondeur/navigator-injector-backbone-command-setup)

For all instructions on how to install all vendors, make use of the grunt tasks and running it in general, please refer to
the documentation of [navigator-injector-backbone-command-setup](https://github.com/PaulTondeur/navigator-injector-backbone-command-setup)

As for any TodoMVC application counts; there are many ways to achieve the same functional end-result. This is one way of doing it
by using navigator.js and injector.js, but there are many other ways these libraries can be used. Feel free to fork this project
and show how you would have written this.
